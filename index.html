<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
Finding the roots of small, simple functions is just that - simple. For example, with \(f(x)=x^2-1\), you can either solve for \(x\) using a difference of squares or as a shortcut, factor, yielding \(x=\pm 1\) as the \(x\)-coordinates of the roots.
</p>
<p>
However, if we are faced with \(f(x)=cos(x)-x\), finding the root becomes considerably harder. To get an approximation of the roots, we can use computational approximation.
</p>
<p>
One way to do this is using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method">the Newton-Raphson method.</a> This method is an application of linear approximation. We start with an initial \(x\) value, \(x_1\), and determine the \(x\)-coordinate where the tangent at \(x_1\) intersects the \(x\)-axis. This new \(x\) value becomes \(x_2\). We can write the approximation for the next \(x\) value as 
$$x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f^\prime(x_n)}$$
</p>
<p>
This process can repeated until the result is close enough (or actually is), the root, \(r\) of \(f(x)\). This means that 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty}x_n= r$$.
</p>

<h2>How to use the program</h2>
<p>
Use the buttons to input the function. If you click on a function, such as \(sin()\), your input will automatically be used as the argument for that function. To go back (to your previous <i>function level</i>), use the close paranthesis <span><b> ) </b> button.
For functions such as \(-cos(x)\), click <kbd>1</kbd>,<kbd>(-)</kbd>,<kbd>*</kbd>, <kbd>cos</kbd>,<kbd>x</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
When you are ready to graph the function, click <b>Update</b>.
Choose your starting \(x\) value (\(x_1\)) by left-clicking on the graph or by using the text box. Make sure to make \(x_1\) as close to the root as possible. Then set the number of iterations. The number of iterations serves both as a sensitivity setting and also as a way to ensure that the root-finding process stops at some point. A maximum of 99 iterations is allowed. Click <b>Find root</b> to start the process. The result will be shown in the bottom left corner.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: The Newton-Raphson method does not apply to functions without roots. An "incorrect" result will be given</b>
